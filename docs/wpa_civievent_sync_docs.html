Provides CiviCRM Event content types per CiviCRM Event Type.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



** CREDITS **

WPA CiviEvent Sync module is based on:
Civi Event Node module <http://drupal.org/node/194628#comment-1219728>



** GENERAL **

Each node is tied to a CiviCRM Event record: creating a new node creates a matching event record.
Updating the node updates the event record data.
Admins get a link from the node to the Civi event record page.s



** SETUP **

On installation, the module will automatically create a content type for all CiviCRM event types.
You then need to create the date field and add it to all the content types:
  1. Go to admin/content/types
  2. For the 'civi-event' content type, add a field:
     - type 'date'
     - name 'event_date'
     - required



** USAGE **

The use case is that all event types will require matching vocab terms.
However, after creating a new Event Type, the associated Drupal vocabulary must be synchronized.
Follow these instructions to add a new Event Type:
  1. Add the Event Type in CiviCRM
  2. Go to admin/content/wpa_civievent_sync in Drupal
  3. Click 'Update vocabulary'
  4. Follow the 'edit content type' link for the new types you created

User permissions are provided for creating, editing own, and deleting own nodes.
Note that deleting a node DOES NOT delete the CiviCRM record.



** TECHNICAL DETAILS **

This is a node type module: is defines a node type as follows:
- machine name: wpa_civievent_sync
- human name:   WPA CiviEvent Sync

Each time a node of this type is created, a Civi Event record is also created.
Because CCK lacks an API, the date field must be added manually by an admin.
The field name is hardcoded as a constant into this module as 'event_date': redefine it if necessary.



** TO DO **

- use CiviCRM theming to warn the admin user NOT to edit the date on the CiviCRM side (because it won't sync back to drupal)

$node->{WPA_CIVIEVENT_SYNC_DATE_FIELD}[0] looks like this:

Array
(
	[value] => 2012-10-26 11:00:00
	[value2] => 2012-10-26 12:00:00
	[timezone] => Europe/London
	[offset] => 3600
	[offset2] => 3600
	[timezone_db] => UTC
	[date_type] => datetime
)



$old_event looks like this, because the v3 API does what effectively amounts to a search:
